trogon-lobby
=================
It is a matchmaking server and lobby for finding and playing multiplayer online
games in a web browser using simple HTML and javascript.

The games are called trogons because they conform to the simple 'trogon' game
API.

This is the trogon lobby.

Features:
* Accounts with statistics.
* Chat across games with private messages, announcements, lobbies, public rooms.
* Games must conform only to a simple documented API.
* Example games (tictactoe, TODO: hangman) provided.

To use this:
* Clone this repository.
* Look at the game documentation (TODO: link).
* Look at the example tictactoe and hangman games.
* Write your game to conform to the documented game API.
* Run this program on a web server somewhere.
* Get people into the lobby and playing games.

Why would this be useful to you?
* You have some games you would like people to play.
* You want to write games but you don't want to deal with the lobby, matchmaking and chat elements.
* You are happy for those games to conform to a simple API for the sake of the
  aforementioned conveniences.

In the future maybe:
* Handle games with more than 2 players.
* Player and game sharing with other lobbies.
* Better account management features.
* A webservice API for games and account handling.
